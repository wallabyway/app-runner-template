#### View Revit Model in Browser

To create a simple 'View Revit Model in a Browser', use this prompt in Cursor:

```
Create a minimal Python Flask backend (with /api/token, /api/upload, /api/status/<urn>, and /api/list endpoints using .env containing APS client ID, secret, and bucket name in utils.py). 
Use `/signeds3upload` and `/batchcompleteupload` endpoint for the upload, encode the urn f"urn:adsk.objects:os.object:{BUCKET_KEY}/{urn}" and then translate to svf2.
Finally, create a index.html frontend with an upload button and a combo box to upload, translate, and view .rvt models using the Autodesk Viewer SDK. 
No comments or error checking, using only server.py, utils.py, and index.html.
```

#### Run it using:

```
python server.py
```
